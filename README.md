# 🚀 LeetCode DSA Journey

This repository contains my daily LeetCode problem-solving practice in C++.

I try to solve **at least 1 problem every day** and upload the solution here to build strong **Data Structures & Algorithms** skills for:

- Coding interviews  
- GATE CS  
- Software Development  

---

## 📅 My Goal
Solve LeetCode daily without breaking the streak and master:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Recursion
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
